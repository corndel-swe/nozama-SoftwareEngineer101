# Day 1 Exercise 2

Our goal in this exercise is to connect to the database from our code.

Take a look at
[connecting to a database](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/javalin/connecting-to-a-database.html).

In `DB.java` we have imported the dependencies, but we haven't connected to the
database yet.

## Todo

- [ ] Make sure that the `dbUrl` is set correctly.

- [ ] Make sure that there's a static method `getConnection()` that returns a
      `Connection` to the database.

- [ ] Run the tests with `./mvnw test -Dtest=D1E2Tests` to ensure they pass.
