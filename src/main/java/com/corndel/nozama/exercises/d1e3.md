# Day 1 Exercise 3

Our goal in this exercise is to create methods to read and write data in our
database.

In `repositories/UserRepository.java` you will find a `UserRepository` class.
This class contains methods to interact with the database.

The method `User.findAll` has been implemented already. Note that the `password`
is not included in the returned objects.

## Todo

- [ ] Take a look at
      [querying for data](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/javalin/adding-a-model-layer.html).

- [ ] Check out the `UserRepository::findAll` method to see how it is set up.

- [ ] Take a look at
      [querying with substitutions](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/javalin/adding-a-model-layer-2.html)

- [ ] Implement `User.findById(id)` which returns a single user, found by their
      ID. Test again.

- [ ] Run `./mvnw test -Dtest=D1E3Tests` to make sure it passes.

- [ ] Do check out
      [inserting data](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/javalin/adding-a-model-layer-3.html)
      as it will help you in the workshop.
